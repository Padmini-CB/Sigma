## 5. Archetype Strategies

### 5.1 Sage + Jester (Smart Wit)

**Inspiration:** Duolingo's passive-aggressive owl, Zomato's data humor

**Application Examples:**
- "You haven't pushed code to GitHub in 3 days. Recruiters are looking at your empty profile."
- "To the 4,000 people who searched 'How to learn Python in 2 days'... please stop. It takes 4 months."
- "Your resume says 'proficient in Excel'. The interviewer's Excel says otherwise."

### 5.2 Sage + Magician (Radical Efficiency)

**Inspiration:** Zepto's instant delivery positioning, Isha's tech-meets-wisdom

**Application Examples:**
- "Groceries in 10 minutes. Python in 10 weeks. Some things can't be delivered instantly."
- "Debug Your Career" (code syntax meets life advice)
- "Data Structure Your Life" (clean architecture for decisions)

### 5.3 Sage Offer Framing (CRITICAL)

| ❌ Cheap/Desperate | ✅ Sage/Premium |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "50% OFF SALE!" | "Merit-Based Fee Waiver: 50%" |
| "Limited Time Discount" | "Beta Batch Access. Priority code review for first 50." |
| "Buy Now, Pay Later" | "Scholarship for serious learners" |
| "Free Trial" | "Solve this SQL query. If correct, unlock ₹2,000 code." |
